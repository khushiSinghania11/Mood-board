# Mood-board
My latest web project is a platform that enables users to create their own mood boards and slide through their selected images. The website features an intuitive interface that allows users to easily search for and add images to their mood boards. Users can select images based on their preferences, including color scheme, subject matter, and style. The mood board is a visual collage that allows users to experiment with different combinations of images to create a cohesive aesthetic.

Once the user has selected their images, the platform allows them to easily slide through them, viewing each one in full screen. This feature is especially useful for those who want to showcase their mood board to others or present it as part of a creative project. Users can also rearrange their selected images to create a new visual composition, adding or removing images as they go.

To power the image search and selection features, the website utilizes unsplash API that provides a vast database of high-quality, royalty-free images that users can access and use to create their mood boards. With this platform, users can unleash their creativity and experiment with different combinations of images to create a mood board that truly reflects their vision.
